Do children of parents who were close to or over 40 when they were born wish they had younger parents?,"My dad was 58 and my mom was 38 when I was born. Growing up everyone thought my dad was my grandpa. My dad had spent most of his younger years wanting to live and experience life. He later told me, “I have spent my life searching and wanting to find what I was missing in life, little did I know it was having a family”. My dad was wise beyond his years and was truly the best father a child could ask for. At very young age I began to watch my dad age before me and become very sick. Most of my teenage years he was in the hospital and when I was 17 years old he passed away. Do I wish my dad had been younger ….yes and no. Yes, I wish he was younger in the hopes that he may have still been alive. He missed so much of my life (grandkids, graduations, marriage and family). No, because had he been younger he would not have been the person who raised me to be who I am today."
What did a nurse do or say that made you immediately request another nurse?,"When I was 17 years old my dad was in the hospital. He was dying and was on life support and there was nothing more they could do for him. My brother (who was 25 at the time) and I decided to withdrawal life support as he had always made his wishes very clear that he did not want to be kept alive on machines. My entire world was shattered and I was inconsolable. My high school boyfriend at the time was trying to calm me down. We were standing near the elevators at the hospital and he was hugging me while I fell apart. Out from the elevator comes a nurse who loudly yells, “ugh, get a room”. I lift my head as she is walking away and proceeded to walk after her. As I turned the corner she was gone the only unit she could have gone into was the CVICU (cardiovascular intensive care unit) where my dad was. The unit was locked down but I seen through the window in the door the nurse who had said those terrible things to me. I went to the first nurse I could find and told her what happened. She immediately called a supervisor and he showed up pretty quickly. I had filled him in on what she had told me. Ironically she was just coming on shift as my dads nurse. When the supervisor had advised her of the situation she had told him that she was sorry and that she was a “Christian women”. Supervisor had said she wanted to apologize to me directly. I told him No because in my emotional state I probably would have just taken a swing at her. I advised the supervisor I wanted her removed from my dads care, I did not accept her apology and I want her to live with the fact that on the worst day of my life she spoke some of the most hurtful and untrue things I have ever heard from a complete stranger and that a true “Christian women” would never have said such horrible things to another person. Later that day my dad died. That was 16 years ago but I have never forgotten that nurse and what she said to me. All I can hope for is that she learned her lesson, which she probably did not. I now am a nurse myself and I could never imagine ever saying something so hurtful not only as a human being but as a nurse."
